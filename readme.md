- Styled with Tailwind CSS and uses custom colors (#802c6e and #f7aa35) for the theme.

## Technologies Used

## How It Works

# Fetching Products
The products are fetched from the Fake Store API when the page loads. The product data includes the product image, title, price, and description.

# Search Feature
A search bar allows users to filter the displayed products. As the user types in the search bar, the products matching the search query are displayed.

# Product Modal
When a product is clicked, a modal opens displaying more details about the product, such as the description and quantity available.

# Responsive Design
The page is built with a responsive design to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, and the product grid adapts for optimal viewing on all devices.
